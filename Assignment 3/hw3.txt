Q1: 
Since the below for-loop using “case_long_iso_time_style” is removed, 
the date display will follow the traditional Unix format. Therefore,
the line “case_long_iso_time_style” is not useful anymore. In fact, it is
not necessary to remove that line. However, to keep the code concise and
clear, the line is removed.

Q2:
With the patch being applied, “ls -l” will display the traditional Unix
format. However, for people who do not understand English, this format 
becomes a trouble. They may not be able to read the date and the time. 

Q3:
Since the script is invoke on an empty file, the program is not able to
get indexed lines and shows an error: “IndexError: list index out of
range”

Q4:
When I run the program on Python3, there is a syntax error saying “except 
IOError as (errno, strerror):”. That’s because Python3 applies a new I/O 
library and supports different syntaxes from Python2.
