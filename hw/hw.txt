Question1:
The answer is Yes because the bytes going across the network are already encrypted.
(1) The answer is still Yes because the private key is still concealed so that knowing all keystrokes are not enough to attack the account

Hence, it  always works if the file is not currently being modified.
We can ask the sender to write down the public key and compare it with the content in the file containing the public key.
