1. “man SP -k <word>”
I discovered it by typing “man man”

2. “whereis SP cp Enter” 
cp: /bin/cp /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1.gz
“whereis SP wc Enter” 
wc: /usr/bin/wc /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1.gz

3. “find SP /usr/bin/? Enter”
I found three of them: X, w and [
“whatis SP X Enter”
X: a portable, network-transparent window system
“whatis SP w Enter”
w: Show who is logged on and what they are doing
“whatis SP [ Enter”
[: a shell related program that does not have man pages

4. “ls SP -l SP /usr/bin/cc Enter”
File that’s executed is gcc

5. “chmod SP g-s” clears the set group ID (becomes -) of the directory

6. “find SP . SP -mtime SP -3”
I discovered this by typing “man find”

7. “find SP / SP -mtime SP -3”
I discovered this by typing “man find”

8. “whereis SP find Enter”
By typing this, I found find is under the directory /bin.
“ls SP /bin SP -l Enter”
By typing this, I found there’re 18 symbolic links under the same 
directory of find.

9. “ls SP /usr/lib SP -l SP -t Enter”
The oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory is: 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   587364 Nov 24  2009 libsqlite3.so.0.8.6
“ls directory -l -t” lists the directory and orders them in time.

10. The locale command gets data from its environmental variables, 
including “LC_CTYPE”, “LC_COLLATE”, “LC_TIME”, 
“LC_NUMERIC”, “LC_MONETARY” and “LC_MESSAGES”

12.
C-a: Move to the beginning of the line (`move-beginning-of-line')
C-b: Move backward one character (`backward-char')
C-c: Mode-specific prefix
C-d: (delete-char) deletes the character after point, similar to Delete,
but regardless of whether the region is active
C-e: Move to the end of the line (`move-end-of-line')
C-f: Move forward one character (`forward-char')
C-g: Quitting with C-g is the way to get rid of a partially typed command,
or a numeric argument that you don’t want
C-h: The prefix key C-h stands for “help”
C-j: Insert a paragraph break (two newlines) and check the previous
paragraph for unbalanced braces or dollar signs (tex-terminate-paragraph)
C-k: (kill-line) erases (kills) a line at a time
C-l: Scroll the selected window so the current line is the center-most 
text line; on subsequent consecutive invocations, make the current line the 
top line,the bottom line, and so on in cyclic order. 
Possibly redisplay the screen too 
(recenter-top-bottom)                                  
C-n: Move down one screen line (`next-line')
C-o: Insert a blank line after the cursor (open-line)
C-p: Move up one screen line (`previous-line')
C-q: (1)followed by any non-graphic character inserts 
that character                                  
(2)followed by a sequence of octal digits inserts 
the character with the specified octal character code
C-r: Incremental search backward (isearch-backward)
C-s: Incremental search forward (isearch-forward)
C-t: Transpose two characters (transpose-chars)
C-u: specify a numeric argument is to type C-u (universal-argument) 
followed by some digits, or (for a negative argument) a minus sign 
followed by digits
C-v: Scroll forward by nearly a full window (scroll-up-command)
C-w: Kill the region (kill-region)
C-y: Yank last killed text (`yank')
C-z: On a text terminal, suspend Emacs; on a graphical display, 
“minimize” the selected frame (suspend-emacs) 
I found this by typing “C-h SP r Enter”

13. C-g gets rid of a partially typed command, or a numeric argument that 
you don’t want. It is a relatively safe way to quit an executing progress.
I found this by typing “C-h SP r Enter”

14. "Yanking" means reinserting text previously killed. It’s a usual way
to move or copy text.

15. The output of ls SP -l is: total 394464
The output of Emacs dired command is: total used in directory 394552 
available 3106508
ls -l only lists the directories (without subdirectories or hidden 
directories), but the directory listing of the Emacs dired command lists 
both the used and available directories
